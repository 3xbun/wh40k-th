### DETACHMENTS RULES

> [!EXAMPLE]- FEED THE SWARM
> In your Command phase each HARVESTER unit from your army that is within range of an objective marker you control can Regenerate one friendly TYRANIDS unit that is within 6" of it. A unit can only be regenerated once per phase. Each time a unit regenerates, do one of the following:  
> - One model in that unit regains up to D3 lost wounds.
> - One destroyed INFANTRY model (excluding CHARACTERS) is returned to that unit with its full wounds remaining. If that unit is an ENDLESS MULTITUDE unit, up to 3 destroyed models are returned instead.
